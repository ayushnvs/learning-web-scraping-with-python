# Making A trading Bot

In this project which is named as **project-mining**, I am trying to make a trading bot.

This project is not related to any trading platform and for now, it is totally going to contain the codes which contains the logic of trading mathematics without any attachment to any real trading platform. And hence, you will not see any trading APIs in the code.

Since this project is in its initial phase, there has not been any solid ideas or plan on how this project will proceed further. It may simply invovle codes with pure mathematical logic or it may also include neural network models. 

The data that is being used for creating this bot has not been taken directly for any data collection site. It has been totally scraped by myself on my PC. And, if necessary and required, data from other source may also be used with proper citation of the source.
